# quasi-linear-PDE-optimal-control
Numerical solver of optimal control problems governed by quasilinear parabolic partial differential equations

for documentation, type
pydoc filename (e.g. pydoc OCP)

choose and uncomment the example in the __main__ section of one of the following .py files:

quasi_linear_solver_t.py
sqp_quasi_linear.py
semi_smooth_quasi_linear.py 
other_examples.py
error_estimates.py

to run them, an istallation of FEniCS on Anaconda is necessary.

The paraview .py scripts, .xdmf and .psdm files in the visualization folders can be loaded directly in the paraview app.
